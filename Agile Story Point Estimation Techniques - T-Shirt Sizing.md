## What is T-shirt sizing?
T-shirt Sizing is one of the Story points sizing technique to estimate user story usually used in agile projects. It's a relative Estimation Technique.

The term originates from the way T-shirt sizes are indicated in the US. Rather than having T-shirts in sizes 4, 5, 6 etc, there are just a few sizes: Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L) and Extra Large (XL) and so on.

With T-shirt measuring, the development team is made a request to evaluate whether they think a story is extra-small, small, medium, large, extra-large, or double extra-large. By expelling the numerical score, the development team is allowed to think in a more dynamic manner about the exertion associated with a story. The sizes can, if necessary, be given numerical value after the estimation is finished.
